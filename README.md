Player Locked Background
=========================
Test of having a background that is locked to the players view.

This has been discussed by Oculus (http://static.oculus.com/connect/slides/OculusConnect_The_Human_Visual_System_and_the_Rift.pdf) as a potential method of improving comfort by flipping perception that moving through space, to space moving around you.
